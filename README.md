# Umbraco.SimpleFileUpload
A boilerplate example of an Umbraco Angular app to handle file uploads

TODO:  Clone and drop in as a package?  Nuget.  This sone should be a super simple App_Plugin to be used as a dashboard control.  
Extend on a separate repo as a property editor (so a file upload type can be added to a doctype)
